  <h1>The Best Movies According to Obell</h1>
  <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
  <hr />
  <h3>#1-Interstellar</h3>
  <p>This movie did it outstanding compared to other similar movies.</p>
  <h3>#2-Mad Max Fury Road</h3>
  <p>Really cool sci-fi movie with lots of action scenes, I love it 100%.</p>
  <h3>#3-Inception</h3>
  <p>This movie got me thinking about reality in itself, I tried my best to catch up wth the idea, but I need to re-wath
    it to fully understand what it was about.</p>
